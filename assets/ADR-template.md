## Decision
The choice that was made and why.

## Implications
The positive and negative consequences of the decision made.

## Consultation
If taking input from others, they should document it here. Details of those invited
to give input can be recorded, whether they provide input or not. Although consultation
takes place before a decision, it is documented at the end because it can become
long and obscure the decision itself.
